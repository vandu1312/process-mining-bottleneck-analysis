Process Mining & Bottleneck Analysis | BPI 2017 Loan Application Dataset (1.2M+ Events)

Performed large-scale process mining analysis on 1,202,267 event records across 31,509 cases to identify operational bottlenecks and cycle-time drivers.

Cleaned and transformed event log data (Case ID, Activity, Timestamp) using Python (pandas, NumPy) for downstream process analytics.

Conducted variant analysis across 15,930 process variants to assess process fragmentation and behavioral deviations.

Applied Inductive Miner (PM4Py) for process discovery and model generation.

Performed behavioral comparison analysis between standard and long-duration cases using statistical methods.

Identified that ~6.5% of cases exceeded 30-day SLA thresholds.

Quantified that long-running cases exhibited ~74% higher incomplete-file follow-up frequency, indicating rework-driven delays.

Measured waiting-time bottlenecks and rework loops in validation and follow-up stages using time-based performance metrics.

Designed performance KPIs including cycle time, activity frequency, and rework rate.

Derived actionable insight that reducing incomplete-file rework loops could potentially reduce cycle time by 10–20% in high-variance cases.
